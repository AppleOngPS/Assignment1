            <b>FROM OUR FRIENDS AT THE YALE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</b>
            <br/>
            The Yale Center for Environmental Justice is in the process of planning 
            our fourth annual Global Environmental Justice Conference, with this year 
            focusing on the theme of “Environmental Joy.” The conference aims to explore 
            the ways in which environmental and climate justice and the communities engaged 
            in that work generate joy. Guided by the notion that the ultimate goal of most 
            environmental and climate work is to alleviate suffering and increase wellbeing, 
            Environmental Joy will explore and celebrate the diverse ways that environmental 
            justice achieves this goal.One facet of the conference programming we hope to 
            organize is a juried art show soliciting works from artists around the world 
            on the theme of Environmental Joy to be showcased in an exhibition during the
            conference. We are currently seeking any interested students or faculty who
            would be interested in supporting the planning and execution of this call for
            art. If you’re interested in learning more about the opportunity, please
            contact Julia Simon at <a href = "julia.simon@yale.edu. ">julia.simon@yale.edu. </a>

            <b>FACULTY/ALUMNI: POST YOUR ART APPRENTICESHIP/INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES 
            FOR UNDERGRADUATES</b>
            <br/>
            The Yale Arts Apprenticeship Program is an initiative that connects 
            Yale undergraduates, particularly those on financial aid, with professional 
            arts practitioners of any discipline. As an option within Yale’s Summer 
            Experience Award (SEA) funding model, the Arts Apprenticeship must fulfill 
            the same basic requirements. Additional details, as well as those specific 
            to the Arts Apprenticeship are included below. Yale faculty, alumni, or other 
            arts practitioners interested in featuring positions through the program should 
            contact Yale’s Creative Careers advisor. Which Opportunities are Eligible? Must 
            be at least 30 hours/week, for at least 8-weeks over the summer months. Those 
            8-weeks do not have to be continuous if the mentoring Arts Practitioner agrees 
            on a different schedule. The time commitment need not all be in direct contact 
            with the Arts Practitioner. Independent projects, tasks, research, etc. can 
            comprise much of the experience, as long as the Arts Practitioner is checking 
            in regularly with the student to provide oversight and career-based context. 
            The opportunity cannot be with a for-profit organization. The engagement for 
            an Arts Apprenticeship should be directly with an individual Arts Practitioner 
            and not with a company. The only exception to this would be if the company 
            overseeing the apprenticeship were a registered non-profit organization.
