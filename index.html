          The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in
          Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and
          offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our
          website exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital
          publishing and information sharing. It functions as a wiki—all members
          of the School of Art community have the ability to add new, and edit
          most existing content.
