      <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    </subtitle>

    <content class="content">
      The mission of the Yale School of Art is to provide students with
      intellectually informed, hands-on instruction in the practice of an array
      of visual arts media within the context of a liberal arts university. As a
      part of the first institution of higher learning to successfully integrate
      a studio-based education into such a broad pedagogical framework, the Yale
      School of Art has a long and distinguished history of training artists of
      the highest caliber. A full-time faculty of working artists in conjunction
      with a diverse cross-section of accomplished visiting artists collaborate
      to design a program and foster an environment where the unique talents and
      perspectives of individual students can emerge and flourish.

    <content class="content">
      The School of Art is founded on the belief that art is a fundamental force
      in national and international culture, and that one of the primary
      standards by which societies are judged is the quality, creative freedom,
      critical insight, and formal and technical innovation of the visual art
      they produce. The Yale School of Art teaches at the graduate and
      undergraduate levels, and consequently the student body consists of those
      whose primary or exclusive focus is art as well as those for whom art is
      an essential part of a varied course of inquiry. The school currently
      offers degrees and undergraduate majors in the areas of graphic design,
      painting/printmaking, photography, and sculpture.
