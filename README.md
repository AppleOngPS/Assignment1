# Project Name: Yale School of Art

This revamped version of the website represents a significant improvement over the original, with enhanced readability and user-friendly navigation. These improvements are essential for optimizing the user experience. Improved readability, and a user-friendly layout ensures that visitors can easily access and engage with the content. By prioritizing user experience through thoughtful design choices, the website is now more accessible and user-friendly.

# Design Process

This website is focusing on anyone who are interested and want to find out more about the school through the website.As a user, I want the website to be easy to navigate to everypage using the menu bar,providing disticnt and clear category like Home,About,Enrollment,Publication,Feedback,Review,and Login.As a student user type, I want to explore the external and internal aspects of the school.Every page of the website there is different view of aspect of the internal and external of the school.As a reader type,readability will be a important factor,having a clear font,and contrasting colors to enhance the overall user experience.

I used Figma software to create my wireframe.Below is the attached link for the desktop view and mobile view.

# Features

In this section, I will go over the different parts of my project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allow user to navigate around the pages using the menus bar

Feature 2 - allow user to write the full version of the post detail, by clicking click more in the homepage

Feature 3 - allows users display their query or feedback in review page, by having them fill out feedback page to submit

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, example:

Feedback page:
Go to Feedback page

Try to submit without filling any details
Expected result: A alert will pop out to fill up last details that you did not fill up

Try to submit the form without filling up the name
Expected result: Alert will pop up if you need not fill up this field

Try to submit the form without filling up the email
Expected result: Alert will pop up if you need not fill up or not fill up correctly this field

Try to submit the form without filling up the subject
Expected result: Alert will pop up if you need not fill up this field

speical bugs:

one task will be when I fill up everything, and press submit in the feedback page. All the details clear off except for the message.when i go to the review page it will appear all the details from whatever that i have submmitted!

# tested

In addition, this section I will show how my project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

The project has been tested on multiple browsers (google chrome(default),Firefox,Internet explorer,mircosoft edge) to ensure a consistent user experience.The project is fully compatible with the different browser, displaying as intended.However screens with a larger display area, the layout is not proportionate.

feedback form was tested and display on the review page
login page was tested and once everything is fill up correctly it will pop a successful alert.
