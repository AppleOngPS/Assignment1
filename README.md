# Assignment1

Project Name: Yale School of Art

This revamped version of the website represents a significant improvement over the original, with enhanced readability and user-friendly navigation. These improvements are essential for optimizing the user experience. Improved readability, and a user-friendly layout ensures that visitors can easily access and engage with the content. By prioritizing user experience through thoughtful design choices, the website is now more accessible and user-friendly.

# Design Process

This website is focusing on anyone who are interested and want to find out more about the school through the website.As a user, I want the website to be easy to navigate to everypage using the menu bar,providing disticnt and clear category like Home,About,Enrollment,Publication,Feedback,Review,and Login.As a student user type, I want to explore the external and internal aspects of the school.Every page of the website there is different view of aspect of the internal and external of the school.As a reader type,readability will be a important factor,having a clear font,and contrasting colors to enhance the overall user experience.

I used Figma software to create my wireframe.Below is the attached link for the desktop view and mobile view.

# Features

In this section, I will go over the different parts of my project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allow user to navigate around the pages using the menus bar

# Technologies Used

HTML

Testing

CSS

Javascript
the project use JavaScript to adds interactivity and dynamic features to the website, enhancing the user experience.

Figma(WireFrame)
the project use Figma for prototyping, and user interface (UI) design.
Example like how does the website in desktop look like in the mobile view.Quick look on how the overview layout look like and able to follow to do the final code using html,css,javascript.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

login form:
Go to the "login" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
