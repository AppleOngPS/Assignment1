        The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic
        Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers
        undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our website
        exists as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and
        information sharing. It functions as a wiki—all members of the School of
        Art community have the ability to add new, and edit most existing
        content.
